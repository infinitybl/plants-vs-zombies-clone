# plants-vs-zombies-clone
Clone of one level in the Plants vs Zombies game created using Python and Pygame

This is a remake of the first level in the Plants vs Zombies game created using Python and the Pygame libary.
I implemented 6 plant towers and 6 zombie types from the original game along with the shovel feature.
The game goes on infinitely until the zombies eat your brains out.
You can check it out in the YouTube video below.
