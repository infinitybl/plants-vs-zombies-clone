# plants-vs-zombies-clone
Clone of one level in the Plants vs Zombies game created using Python and Pygame

This is a remake of 5 levels from the Arkanoid Advance GBA game created using Python and the Pygame libary.
I implemented all of the 7 powerups from the original game, added keyboard and mouse controls, and put in high scores as well. 
You can check it out in the YouTube video below.

NOTE: I removed all asset files such as backgrounds, music and sprites using a .gitignore due to copyright
